# 100 Days Of ML



## Day 1 : March 30 , 2020
 
**Today's Progress** : Today I worked on DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network). Implemented on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset to generate Handwritten digits.

**Thoughts** : I will try DCGAN on slightly more complex datasets such as Fashion MNIST and CIFAR-10.

## Day 2 : March 30 , 2020

<!-- **Today's Progress** : I have completed initial training and testing of the model and submitted to the Kaggle . 

**Thoughts** : The score have to be improved I will try my best on it and it is really fun .
