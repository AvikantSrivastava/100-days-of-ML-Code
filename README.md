# 100 Days Of ML Code


## Day 1 : March 30 , 2020
 
**Today's Progress** : Today I worked on DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network). Implemented on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset to generate Handwritten digits.

**Thoughts** : I will try DCGAN on slightly more complex datasets such as Fashion MNIST and CIFAR-10.

## Day 2 : March 31 , 2020

**Today's Progress** : Built a network for CIFAR-10 dataset comprising Convolution, Max Pooling, Batch- Normalization and Dropout layers.
Studied about dropout and batch normalization in detail and various ways to avoid overfitting in a network.

**Thoughts** : Looking forward to tweak the model and obtain a better accuracy and reduce the number of parameters.
